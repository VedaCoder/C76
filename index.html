			<h2>Types of Black Holes</h2>
			<p>There are three types of black holes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Stellar black holes: These are the smallest kind of black holes and are made when a really big star dies.</li>
				<li>Intermediate black holes: These are bigger than stellar black holes but smaller than supermassive black holes. Scientists are not sure how they are formed.</li>
				<li>Supermassive black holes: These are the biggest kind of black holes and are found in the center of galaxies. Scientists think they are formed by merging smaller black holes.</li>
